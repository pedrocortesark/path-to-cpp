# 🧠 C++ Learning Path — From C# to Low-Level Geometry

Welcome! This repository documents my personal learning journey from C#/.NET into the world of **C++**, with a focus on **geometry, performance**, and **Rhino plugin development**.

## 🎯 Why this journey?

As a computational designer and developer working with Rhino, Grasshopper, and custom AEC tools, I found myself needing lower-level control — especially when dealing with:

- Large-scale geometry operations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Rhino SDK and plugin development
- Interoperability (e.g. IFC, mesh kernels, etc.)

This repo is where I build and share everything I’m learning, one example at a time.

## 🗂️ Structure

### `01_basics_cpp/`
General C++ learning: syntax, pointers, memory management, control structures, and STL.

### `02_rhino_cpp/`
Projects using the Rhino C++ SDK — from simple geometry to custom plugins and kernel-level operations.

### `03_experiments/` (future)
Larger or more speculative projects — like IFC importers or façade automation tools.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 (with C++ development tools)
- Rhino 8 (for Rhino-related examples)
- Rhino C++ SDK (available via [developer.rhino3d.com](https://developer.rhino3d.com))
